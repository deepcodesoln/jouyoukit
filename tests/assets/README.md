# Kanjidic2 Subset

libjyk provides a subset of the kanjidic2 XML file for use in tests. The subset
contains a single jouyou kanji per unique grade. The subset can be recreated by
reducing an original kanjidic2 XML file to the following kanji:

1. 一 (grade 1)
1. 引 (grade 2)
1. 悪 (grade 3)
1. 愛 (grade 4)
1. 圧 (grade 5)
1. 胃 (grade 6)
1. 亜 (grade 8)

The XML file for the libjyk subset does not include the embedded schema.
